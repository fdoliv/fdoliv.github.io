I am a Software Developer and Computer Scientist with over {{ years_of_experience }} years of hands-on experience architecting and developing robust software solutions. My academic foundation, a Master of Science from the prestigious Informatics Center at the Federal University of Pernambuco (CIn-UFPE), is rooted in a deep exploration of distributed systems, which I apply daily to solve real-world engineering challenges.

My professional focus lies at the intersection of theory and practice in distributed systems, specifically across cloud, fog, and edge computing. As a contributor to the Modeling of Distributed and Concurrent Systems ([MoDCS](https://www.modcs.org/){:target="_blank"}) research group, I didn't just study systems; I helped maintain the [Mercury Modeling Tool](https://www.modcs.org/?page_id=2392){:target="_blank"}, a platform that puts complex performance and dependability theories into practice.

This passion for performance was ignited during my time with the [UNAME Research Group](http://dgp.cnpq.br/dgp/espelhogrupo/716273){:target="_blank"}, where I delved into High-Performance Computing (HPC) and performance evaluation. My research has been shared at international conferences and published in respected journals, always with the goal of bridging the gap between academic discovery and industrial application.

Beyond formal research, I apply my skills to projects with tangible community impact, such as "[VÃ´ na Feira](http://lmts.uag.ufrpe.br/content/v%C3%B4-na-feira){:target="_blank"}", a platform I helped develop to empower local family farmers by connecting them directly with their market.

My technical toolkit is broad, with deep expertise in Linux systems administration and proficiency across languages including Java, Python, Go, and C. I also develop high-quality Android applications and am constantly exploring emerging technologies to stay at the forefront of the industry.

My core research and professional interests remain centered on the challenges of modern computing:

- Performance and Dependability Evaluation
- High-Performance Computing & Cloud-Native Systems
- Virtualization and Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Internet of Things (IoT) Architecture
- Stochastic Petri Nets & Analytical Modeling
- Data Intensive applications

This blog is where I share insights from my research, solutions to complex programming problems, and my perspective on the ever-evolving world of technology. It is my space to collaborate with and contribute to our global tech community.
