Hi, I'm Felipe Dias, a computer science professional from Pernambuco, Brazil, with over {{ years_of_experience }} years of experience in software development. I earned my Master of Science in Computer Science in March 2023 from the Informatics Center at the Federal University of Pernambuco ([Cin UFPE](https://www.cin.ufpe.br)). I also hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco ([UFRPE](http://www.ufrpe.br/)).

My work focuses on distributed systems, particularly in cloud, fog, and edge computing. I’ve been a member of the Modeling of Distributed and Concurrent Systems ([MoDCS](http://www.modcs.org/)) research group, where I contributed to the development and maintenance of the [Mercury Modeling Tool](http://www.modcs.org/?p=2264).

During my academic journey, I was part of the UNAME Research Group, where I explored high-performance computing and performance evaluation. I’ve shared my findings at national and international conferences and published in recognized journals.

Outside academia, I’ve worked on practical projects like [Vô na Feira](http://app.uag.ufrpe.br/vonafeira/), a platform that helps local family farmers market their produce.

I have experience in Linux systems administration and programming in C, R, Python, Java, and PHP. I also develop Android applications and enjoy exploring emerging technologies.

My research interests include:
- Performance and dependability evaluation
- High-performance computing
- Virtualization techniques
- Internet of Things
- Stochastic Petri nets
- Analytical modeling

I use my blog to share my research, programming experiences, and thoughts on related topics. It’s a space for collaboration and exchanging ideas with the tech community.
