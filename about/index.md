My name is Felipe Oliveira, a computer science student from Pernambuco - Brazil, and I am a computer programmer with 4 years of experience. I prepare me to become a researcher. I am B.S. in Computer Science at Federal Rural University of Pernambuco ([UFRPE](http://www.ufrpe.br/){:target="_blank"}), and I have experience in Computer Science with a focus on Distributed Systems, researching in the field of high performance computing and performance evaluation at [UNAME Research Group](https:uname.group){:target="_blank"}. I composed and published some papers in national and international conferences and journals in the 2014-2019 period. Also in this period, I have helped on the creation of a site to a social project that auxiliary local familiar farmers to sell your products to clients, [Vô na Feira](http://app.uag.ufrpe.br/vonafeira/){:target="_blank"}. Now, I'm M.Sc. candidate in Computer Science at Informatics Center of the Federal University of Pernambuco - ([Cin UFPE](https://www.cin.ufpe.br){:target="_blank"}) and member of group Modeling of Distributed and Concurrent Systems ([MoDCS](http://www.modcs.org/){:target="_blank"}). My skills include Linux systems administration, computer programming in C, R, Python, Java and PHP languages and development of applications to Android devices.

My research interests are:
