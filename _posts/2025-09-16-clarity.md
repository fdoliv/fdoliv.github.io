I spent some time this week exploring Microsoft Clarity, and it's fantastic! Itâ€™s a tool that lets you visually understand your users with features like click maps and session replays. I was surprised to see how easy it was to set up and get insights in some hours.

It's completely free, which is incredible for the value it delivers. It's a great way to stop guessing and start seeing what your users are actually doing. Highly recommended!
