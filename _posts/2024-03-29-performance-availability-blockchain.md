**Abstract**: Through the blockchain-as-a-service paradigm, one can provide the infrastructure required to host blockchain-based applications regarding performance and dependability-related attributes. Many works evaluated issues and mitigated them to reach a high throughput or better downtime and availability indexes. However, to the best of our acknowledgment, studies regarding both characteristics are yet to be performed. This paper presents a performance evaluation of a private infrastructure hosting a blockchain-based application. As we monitored the system, we noticed some increase in resource consumption that may be associated with software aging issues on the hyperledger fabric platform or its basic components. Also, the impact of this resource increment on the probability of the system being operational has been evaluated. When consumption issues were considered, one of the transaction types increased the RAM consumption by almost 80% in less than 3 h, reducing the system availability to 98.17%. For scenarios without resource increment issues on the infrastructure, the availability reached 99.35%, with an annual downtime of 56.43 h.
